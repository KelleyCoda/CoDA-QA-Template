# CoDA-QA-Template
Scheduling some time to test is imperative! Testing allows you to find &amp; resolve bugs before you ship to users. When you work with your developer, ask for them to send you copies of the application at certain milestones so you can test &amp; resolve bugs. The best time to do this is when the developer has completed all the goals for a certain feature.  

Click every button, go back to your design strategy and make sure your product allows users to accomplish their tasks. Take detailed notes, so that your developer can easily understand and solve issues.

Here’s a walkthrough of how CoDA compiles this documentation. In a table-based document, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, add the following columns:

- Title - A short descriptive title, for quick reference of the issue
- Bug, Issue, Comment, Praise - This is a type field that helps in our prioritization.
  -- Bug - A bug describes feedback about something that does function properly. For example:
  -- Issue - An issue comes up when something works functionally, but has issues. For example: our developer built a way to search through records, but I didn’t know how to clear that search. I suggested adding a “clear” button, so a user can go back to a complete list.
  -- Comment - Similar to an issue, comments are more abstract feelings about something that is not quite right, but you may not have actionable resolutions. These often serve as placeholders for further discussion.
  -- Praise - It’s always nice to give positive feedback, too!
- Priority (1-10, 10 Highest) - This helps the developer know which items are most pressing
- Layout/Link - Where were you in the application, so that the developer knows where to solve. For example, on the homepage of a website. Use “global” to describe something on every screen.
- Notes - In greater detail, describe what went wrong and what you expected to happen. This can include notes from the developer when they work on it.
- Reported by - If you have a whole team testing, this helps identify who to ask for greater clarity.
- Example - This could be a link or a screenshot of the issue at hand, sometimes annotated.
- Operating System / Context - what device, operating system, and software you were using when you encountered this issue (example: MacBook Pro, OS X 10.11.6, Google Chrome Browser). This allows the developer to test whether features work properly across all devices and software.
  -- Status - This helps us track and test the progress of the issue. Our stages are:
  -- In Progress - The developer is working on this issue.
  -- Done - The developer has solved the issue.
  -- Approved - The issue has been re-tested and is working.
  -- Rejected - The issue has been re-tested and is not working.
  -- On Ice - We are saving this item to work on later.

Once you have gone through and documented any bugs and issues, go through these with your developer, preferably in a live session, in case there are any questions they have. Allow your developer to fix these issues & schedule a follow-up session to review the changes when they are done.
